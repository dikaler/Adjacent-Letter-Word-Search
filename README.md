# Adjacent Letter Word Search GUI

The Adjacent Letter Word Search script allows users to input a board of letters and a word they want to search for. The word can be formed from adjacent, neighboring cells. If the word can be formed, the script will highlight the word in green; otherwise, the entire board will be highlighted in red.
